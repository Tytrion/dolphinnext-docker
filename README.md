DolphinNext docker version (CECAD)
========
DolphinNext original repository is located at https://github.com/UMMS-Biocore/dolphinnext.

This Docker configuration is based on https://github.com/UMMS-Biocore/dolphinnext-docker and https://github.com/UMMS-Biocore/dolphinnext-studio

For the Dolphinnext quick start guide please check: 
https://dolphinnext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dolphinNext/quick.html

DolphinNext can be run as a standalone application using a docker container.
First docker image need to be build, any change in the Dockerfile requires the image to be built.

Build docker image
---------

1. To build docker image first clone one of the latest dolphinnext-docker

```
git clone https://github.com/Tytrion/dolphinnext-docker.git
```

2. Build the image

```
cd dolphinnext-docker
docker build -t dolphinnext-docker .
```

Start the container
---------

1. We move database outside of the container to be able to keep the changes in the database everytime you start the container.

N.B. The database files in /export will need to be backed up regularly

Please choose a directory in your machine to mount and replace `/path/to/mount` with your path. 
* Note: Please don't change the target directory(`/export`) in the docker image. 

```
mkdir -p /path/to/mount
```

2. While running the container;

```
docker run --name=CECAD-dolphinnext -m 10G -p 8080:80 -v /path/to/mount:/export -dti dolphinnext-docker
```

3. After you start the container, you need to connect to it and start the mysql and apache server usign the command below:

```
docker exec CECAD-dolphinnext /bin/bash
```

Once connected run the startup script located at bin/startup in this repository

```
startup
```

Disconnect from the container leaving it running the background

```
exit
```

4. Verify that `dolphinnext` and `mysql` folders are located inside of the `export` folder:


```
ls /export
```

5. Now, you can open your browser to access dolphinnext using the url below.

http://localhost:8080/dolphinnext

Hosting settings
------
We define `localhost:8080` in /path/to/mount/dolphinnext/config/.sec file and use that to log in or other operations.

See the example file example_.sec_file.txt

You need to change `localhost` to the IP address or domain you use. 
Please update `BASE_PATH` and `PUBWEB_URL` as follows:

```
BASE_PATH = http://localhost:8080/dolphinnext
PUBWEB_URL = http://localhost:8080/dolphinnext/tmp/pub
```

to
```
BASE_PATH = http://your_temporary_domain_name:8080/dolphinnext
PUBWEB_URL = http://your_temporary_domain_name:8080/dolphinnext/tmp/pub
```
* Please don’t change other lines because others are used inside of docker.
